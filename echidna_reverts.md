Make sure test mode is not Assertion
==================================
CASE 1
=

**in case any boolean isn't returned by calling fucntion**
```solidity
function echidna_functionIsCallable() public returns (bool) {
    try this.functionToTest() {
        return true;
    } catch {
        return false;
    }
}
```

To check whether a function is callable in Solidity using Echidna, you can write an assertion function that attempts to call the function and returns true if it succeeds and false if it fails. Here's a general template for such a function:

```solidity
function echidna_functionIsCallable() public returns (bool) {
    try this.functionToTest() returns (bool success) {
        return success;
    } catch {
        return false;
    }
}
```
In this template, replace functionToTest with the name of the function you want to test. This function will return true if functionToTest executes successfully and false if it reverts.





CASE 2
=
**in case any boolean isn't returned by calling fucntion**
```solidity
function echidna_functionIsCallable() public returns (bool) {
    try this.functionToTest() {
        return false;
    } catch {
        return true;
    }
}
```



To check whether a function reverts, you can write an assertion function that calls the function and checks its return value. If the function is supposed to return a boolean value, you can check whether it returns false when it's not supposed to. Here's a general template for such a function:
```solidity
function echidna_functionReverts() public returns (bool) {
    try this.functionToTest() returns (bool success) {
        return !success;
    } catch {
        return true;
    }
}
```
In this template, replace functionToTest with the name of the function you want to test. This function will return true if functionToTest reverts and false if it executes successfully.

Please note that these are general templates and might need to be adjusted depending on the specifics of your contract and the function you're testing. Also, keep in mind that Echidna is a property-based fuzzer, so it's designed to break user-defined invariants, not to test for specific outcomes like function calls or reverts. Therefore, these assertions should be used as part of a larger property that Echidna can test
