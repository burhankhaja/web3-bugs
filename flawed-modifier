Unsafe :=
 modifier partnerCondition() {
    if (msg.sender == partner) {
      require(block.timestamp >= lockPeriodForPartner);
      _;
    } else {
     _;
    }
  }

  in this modifier it is checking if the lock period for partner has been over if it has it will trigger the function 
  But it got itself in big trouble by defining else {_;} block
  this will let others to do what partner was supposed to do

  Safe (Disclaimer: Not Sure!):=
  modifier partnerCondition() {
    if (msg.sender == partner) {
      require(block.timestamp >= lockPeriodForPartner);
      _;
    }
  }

  This Won't Allow the Otherwise conditions, because solidity compilers will stop running the modified function when the msg.sender doen't equal to partner
